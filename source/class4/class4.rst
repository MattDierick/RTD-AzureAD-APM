Class 4 - Enable MFA
####################

.. warning :: You can **not** run this class without a F5 SA or F5 SME-UA lead. Please reach out to your local SA/SME-UA lead in order to activate an temporary account for you.

   #. EMEA : Matthieu
   #. USA : Jason or Shannon
   #. APCJ : Shain

In this class, we will use another user account (created by SA/SME-UA), with MFA enabled for this account.

Let's say, a SA/SME created the account ``matt@f5access.onmicrosoft.com`` for me. Then he enabled the MFA for this account.
